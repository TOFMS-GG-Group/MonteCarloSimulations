Monte Carlo Methods for Simulating Single-Particles Measured by spICP-TOFMS

This Monte Carlo simulation is designed to provide a simple, user-operable code to simulate
single-particles in the nano- and submicron regimes and mimic signals obtained from 
single-particle inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
