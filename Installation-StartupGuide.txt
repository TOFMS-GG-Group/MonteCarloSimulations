Step 1) Anaconda and VS Code
	A) Go to the anaconda webpage. Download the appropriate, and most recent, software for your device
	   www.anaconda.com/downloads
	B) Document the Python version number
	C) Follow the onscreen instructions for download. 
	D) For Windows, right-click the file and "Run as Administrator."
	   For Mac or Linux, double-click the file.
	E) Click Install Microsoft VS Code, or update software to the most recent version if VS Code is already installed.
	F) Continue to follow any onscreen instructions, clicking Continue or Next to proceed through the installation steps, 
	   and then click Close or Finish on the last page.
Step 2) Opening Anaconda
	Mac
		A) Open Launch Pad -> double-click Anaconda Navigator icon and open it.
		B) Open Finder -> Applications -> double-click Anaconda Navigator
	Windows
		A) Open the Start menu, click Anaconda Navigator to open.
		B) Click the Start button, start typing Anaconda, and click on Anaconda Navigator on the Start menu when you see it
		C) {Optional} Right-click Anaconda Navigator and choose Pin to Start or right-click and choosse More -> Pin to Taskbar
Step 3) Writing Python in VS Code
	A) Open Anaconda Navigator.
	B) Locate and click the Launch button under VS Code.
	C) To use VS Code with Python and Anaconda,some VS Code extensions may be necessary. 
	   Click the Extensions icon in the left pane (puzzle piece). 
	   Note the following extensions: Anaconda Extension Pack, Python, and YAML.
Step 4) Choosing the Python Interpreter
	A) Choose View -> Command Palette
	B) Type Python and then click Python: Select Interpreter
	   Choose the Python version that matches your download (from Step 1B).
	   If you have several options with the same version number, choose the one that includes the names "base" and "conda".
Step 5) Writing Python Code
	A) In VS Code, choose View -> Terminal from the VS Code menu. The terminal will pop-up on the bottom of the console
	B) In the Terminal, type python and press Enter. 
	   The >>> prompt is the Python interpreter; if you type python code on this line and press Enter, the code will execute.
	C) Type 1+1 and press Enter. The answer should appear followed by another >>> prompt.
	   This ensures that your Python development environment is all set up and ready to use. This step does not need to be repeated.
	D) In the VS Code Terminal, press CTRL+D or type exit() and press Enter.
	   You should no longer see the >>> prompt.
Step 6) Using Python's Interactive Mode
	A) Open Anaconda Navigator, open VS Code by clicking the Launch button on the Anaconda home page.
	B) If you do not see the Terminal pane at the bottom of the window, choose View -> Terminal from the menu bar.
	C) If the word Terminal is not highlighted at the tope of the pane, click Terminal.
	D) The first prompt is typically for your computer's operating system, and shows the username of the account.
	E) At the operating system command prompt, type the following and press Enter to see what version of Python you're using.
	   python --version
	   You should see Python 3.x.x; if instead you see an error message, you will want to make sure that VS Code was launched 
	   from Anaconda not the Start menu or Launch Pad. If this does not resolve your error see Step 4.
	F) Launch the Python interpreter by typing the following command:
	   python
	   You should now see the >>> prompt.
	G) For further assistance, type help or help() into the command prompt. 
	H) To leave the interpreter, type exit() or CTRL-Z + Return to exit.
Step 7) Creating a Python Development Workspace
	A) Choose File -> Save Workspace As, and navigate to the folder where you want to save the workspace.
	   Name the workspace, and then click Save.
	B) Next, perform one of the following steps to adjust some VS Code settings to indicate the location of the saved workspace:
	   Windows: Choose File -> Preferences -> Settings
	   Mac: Choose Code -> Preferences -> Settings
	C) Click the Open Settings (JSON) icon in the top-right corner (puzzle piece adjacent).
	D) In the next window, select all the lines of code starting with "python.pythonpath". Copy the selected lines to the clipboard.
	E) Click the Split Editor Right icon, near the top-right corner (two side-by-side pages). Two copies of settings.json should 
	   appear side-by-side.
	F) Choose View -> Command Palette. Type open and the select Preferences: Open Workspace Settings(JSON).
	   Click between the setting's curly braces and paste the lines of code there.
	G) Choose File -> Save from the VS Code menu. Then close the Settings and User Settings tabs.
Step 8) Using the Monte Carlo Simulation Code from GitHub
	A) Launch https://github.com/TOFMS-GG-Group/MonteCarloSimulations in your preferred internet browser.
	B) Download the latest version of the MonteCarloSimulations.py file
	C) Move this file to the same location as the Python Workspace that was created in Step 7.
	D) Launch VS Code from the Anaconda Navigator home page.
	E) Open the file from the Explorer pane (left, two overlapping pages). 
	F) All necessary pacakges should install automatically.
	G) User-defined parameters are available between lines 50 and 58. 
	   Particle detection information should be formatted according to the template available on the Monte Carlo GitHub page.
	H) The Monte Carlo Simulations should proceed unimpinged and figures will pop-up periodically. To procceed, click the X on the top-right of the figure.
	   Data can be saved/exported from the simulations should the user specify "WriteInfo" as True.
